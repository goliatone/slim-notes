<p>This is plain text.</p>

<p>This is <em>empasis</em> word.
Another <em>empasis</em> word.
<em>Whole sentense is emphasis</em>
_Multiline emphasis
does not work._</p>

<p>I can also do <strong>bolded</strong> words.
<strong>Really</strong>, markdown is amazing!</p>

<p>All this can be done with * and _ characters, yes * and _</p>

<p>Just surround word like this *word* or _word_ for <em>.
Or **word** or __word__ for <strong></p>
