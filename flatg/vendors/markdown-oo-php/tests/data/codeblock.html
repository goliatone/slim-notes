<p>This is a codeblock test.</p>

<p>Accoring to markdown specification markdown is not processed within codeblock.
Within a code block, ampersands (&amp;) and angle brackets (&lt; and >) are automatically converted into HTML entities.
Nothing else is converted.</p>

<pre><code>This is a test of markdown codeblocks
=====================================

Except &amp; and &lt; and &gt; nothing is converted.
&amp; is converted even if part of an entity &amp;amp;
&lt; is converted even if part of a tag &lt;head&gt;
This _word_ should not be emphasised.</code></pre>

<p>This paragraph lays unders the codeblock.</p>
