This is plain text.

This is *empasis* word.
Another _empasis_ word.
_Whole sentense is emphasis_
_Multiline emphasis
does not work._

I can also do **bolded** words.
__Really__, markdown is amazing!

All this can be done with * and _ characters, yes * and _

Just surround word like this \*word\* or \_word\_ for <em>.
Or \*\*word\*\* or \_\_word\_\_ for <strong>
