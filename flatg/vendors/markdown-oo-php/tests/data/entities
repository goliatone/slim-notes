Markdown states that symbols & and < must be escaped to ease writing.
However if & is part of html entity like &copy; it must not be escaped.
Similary, if < is part of html tag like <head> it must not be escaped as well.
Inside code spans like this `<html><head></head></html>` < is always escaped.
Same rule apply to code blocks like this:

    <html>
        <head><title>"Markdown"</title></title></head>
        <a href="http://example.com?foo=bar&bar=baz">Link</a>
	</html>
