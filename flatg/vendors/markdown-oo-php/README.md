What is Markdown?
=================

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
It is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

See [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for syntax.


What is markdown-oo-php?
========================

It's an object-oriented PHP library capable of converting markdown text to XHTML.


Quick start
=========

Library has two entities: _Text_ and _Filter_
_Text_ represents a piece of text.
_Filter_ is responsible for actual transformation.
_Text_ is passed through filters resulting into html output.

    require_once 'Markdown/Filter.php';

    echo Markdown_Filter::run($markdown);

Advanced usage
==============

Internally, _Filter_ uses a set of filters which extends Markdown_Filter.
A filter is an object which can accept markdown text and return html.
You can write your own filters and use like this:

    $filters = array(
        'Linebreak',            // a built-in filter
        new MyCustomFilter(),   // child of Markdown_Filter
    );
    Markdown_Filter::setDefaultFilters($filters);

    // all transformations now use the custom filter
    echo new Markdown_Text('**Markdown is great!**');

    // you can get current filters set
    Markdown_Filter::getDefaultFilters();

FAQ
===

#### Can your library process very large documents?

Yes. There is known problem with other markdown implementations when PCRE engine fails with very large files.
My library parses input line by line, so as long as you keep lines less than ~1M you'll be okay.

Requirements
===========

  *  PHP  >= 5.3
